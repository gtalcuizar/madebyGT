                    <h2>TLDR; Long Story Short</h2>
                    <p>I designed the Synnch Timesheets Checker—an admin-facing tool for verifying and managing R&D timesheets in compliance with ATO/AusIndustry requirements.</p>
                    <h3>Key Features</h3>
                    <p> The Timesheet Checker dashboard highlights real-time KPIs and uses targeted workflows to help admins prioritise and resolve missed, submitted, or unallocated timesheets.</p>
                    <h3>Impact</h3>
                    <p>The new Checker tool made it easier for admins to spot issues, reduce manual effort, and stay on top of compliance—helping teams submit accurate timesheets on time and with confidence.</p>
                    <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
                    <p>As the sole designer, This project taught me to design admin dashboards with an action-first mindset—highlighting what's missing or needs attention, not just displaying data. </p>
                    <p>I also learned to tailor interfaces based on user roles and time-sensitive workflows, ensuring the right context and controls for both admins and staff.</p>
                    <p>Thinking in terms of evolving data states and compliance timelines helped shape a more responsive, role-aware design.</p>

                <h2>Design Process</h2>
                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>Manually verifying large volumes of R&D timesheets is slow, error-prone, and lacks auditability—making it hard for admins to spot issues, ensure compliance, and drive timely staff submissions for ATO/AusIndustry requirements.</p>

                    <div class="problem-style stagger-item">
                        <b>Role-based Design Boundaries</b>
                        <p>Since this is a verification-only tool, the UI had to enforce clear boundaries—allowing admins to review and flag entries without modifying core data, which is managed in the primary Timesheet UI.</p>
                    </div>
                

                <h3>UI Sketching</h3>
                <p>I designed the Timesheets Checker dashboard with clear KPIs and status filters, structuring the main admin table for high information density using stacked cells to improve scannability.</p>
                <p>I mapped out key workflows for reviewing Unallocated, For Review, and Missed timesheets, and created a complementary staff view focused on clarity and guiding users toward required actions.</p>

                    <b>Problem</b>
                    <p>With dozens—or even hundreds—of timesheet entries flowing in, admins face information overload.</p>
                    <p>For large teams, tracking compliance and data integrity becomes a major challenge.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <b>Designed Solution</b>
                    <p><span class="text-highlight"> The table layout supports at-a-glance scanning, sorting, and filtering</span>. Key data points are highlighted for quick decision-making.</p>
                    <p>We defined the primary admin actions and designed the table to surface them clearly:</p>
                    <div class="research-container stagger-container">
                    <div class="emphasize stagger-item"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">document_search</span>Review missed timesheets</div>
                    <div class="emphasize stagger-item"><span class="material-symbols-outlined">verified</span>Approve or flag submitted entries</div>

                </div>

                    
                </div>
                <div>
                    <b>Why</b>
                    <p>The goal wasn’t just to display staff and timesheet data—it was to prompt meaningful action. By prioritizing clarity, actionability, and visual hierarchy, we’ve made it easier for admins to maintain compliance and  spot issues fast.</p>
                </div>

                
                    <p>Iterated this design since the first draft was convoluted and lacks the emphasis of the 3 main actions. </p>

                        <p>Refer to R&D hours that haven't been formally tagged to any specific activity. By the end of the financial year—and especially during R&D tax incentive submission—<span class="text-highlight"> these hours must be fully allocated for compliance. </span></p>

                    <div class="problem-style stagger-item">

A monthly cycle allows more leeway, while a weekly cycle enables quicker tracking. The goal is to encourage regular logging of R&D hours by staff and admins—ultimately aiming for zero missed timesheets.</p>

                    <b>Problem</b>
                    <p>Staff members often struggle to track which R&D timesheets they’ve submitted and what still needs attention.</p>
                    <p>While they could manually check each month, there was <span class="text-highlight"> no centralized or automated way </span>to view submission status or alert admins of the gaps.</p>

                <div>
                    <b>Designed Solution</b>
                    <p>We created a staff-facing table view that summarizes each user’s R&D time entries across a selected time period.</p>
                    <p>It highlights what’s been submitted, what’s missing, and what needs revision—all in one place.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <b>Why</b>
                    <p>This design promotes clarity, accountability, and compliance. It gives staff members a real-time feedback loop to guide corrections or completions, and helps prevent missed or incomplete entries.</p>
                    <p> It also <span class="text-highlight"> reduces admin overhead </span> by making staff self-aware of their progress—turning compliance into a shared responsibility.</p>

                    <p>Representing R&D compliance concepts like contemporaneity or cycle-based tracking in an intuitive way was a major UI challenge. I had to find ways to surface these rules clearly without overwhelming the user.</p>

                <div>
                    <b>Managing Dense Information</b>
                    <p>Admin tools required a lot of data in one view. Finding the right balance between information density and ease of scanning meant refining layouts, typography, and interaction feedback carefully.</p>
                </div>
